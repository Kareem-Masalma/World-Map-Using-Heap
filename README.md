# World Map
**Project Description:**  
This project to find the shortest path between two countries using Dijkstra's algorithm, using Java.  
The set of data contains 50 countries and 186 edges.  
The Dijkstra's algorithm is implemented with O(V + E) using **Heap Data structur**.  
Shortest Path can be found in 3 categories:
  - Distance (Default)
  - TIme
  - Cost
